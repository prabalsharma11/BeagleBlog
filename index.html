      <h1>The Beagle Blog</h1>
      <p>
        The Beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the
        much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting
        hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior
        tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection
        dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine
        around the world. The beagle is intelligent and is a popular pet due to
        its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
